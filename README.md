# BikeRentalPredictionMLModel

This Bike Rental Prediction Model takes in input data provided by Kaggle and shows my process for creating a fully-functional model that is able to output the predictions for bike rentals based on previous data.

In order to create my model, I first cleaned and prepped the data for the model, which included dimensionality reduction and vectorizing non-numerical data. Then, I used Data Visualizations and Feature Engineering to understand which features have a greater impact on the bike rental demand. Next, I found the numerical correlation between the variables for regression analysis. Finally, I built the model and trained it using the training data and outputted bike rental predictions using the testing data. The bike rental demand ranges from 0 to 7, and I was able to fine-tune the model to have a Mean Absolute Error of roughly 1.
